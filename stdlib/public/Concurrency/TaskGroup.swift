// ==== TaskGroup --------------------------------------------------------------

/// Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.
///
/// A group waits for all of its child tasks
/// to complete or be canceled before it returns.
/// After this function returns, the task group is always empty.
///
/// To collect the results of the group's child tasks,
/// you can use a `for`-`await`-`in` loop:
///
///     var sum = 0
///     for await result in group {
///         sum += result
///     }
///
/// If you need more control or only a few results,
/// you can call `next()` directly:
///
///     guard let first = await group.next() else {
///         group.cancelAll()
///         return 0
///     }
///     let second = await group.next() ?? 0
///     group.cancelAll()
///     return first + second
///
/// Task Group Cancellation
/// =======================
///
/// You can cancel a task group and all of its child tasks
/// by calling the `cancelAll()` method on the task group,
/// or by canceling the task in which the group is running.
///
/// If you call `async(priority:operation:)` to create a new task in a canceled group,
/// that task is immediately canceled after creation.
/// Alternatively, you can call `asyncUnlessCancelled(priority:operation:)`,
/// which doesn't create the task if the group has already been canceled
/// Choosing between these two functions
/// lets you control how to react to cancellation within a group:
/// some child tasks need to run regardless of cancellation,
/// but other tasks are better not even being created
/// when you know they can't produce useful results.
///
/// Because the tasks you add to a group with this method are nonthrowing,
/// those tasks can't respond to cancellation by throwing `CancellationError`.
/// The tasks must handle cancellation in some other way,
/// such as returning the work completed so far, returning an empty result, or returning `nil`.
/// For tasks that need to handle cancellation by throwing an error,
/// use the `withThrowingTaskGroup(of:returning:body:)` method instead.

// We would be able to abstract over TaskGroup<..., Failure> equal to Never
